# Automate-traversal-in-a-Singly-Linked-List
My code will allow for the automation of the traversal in a singly linked list
This program is used to implement traversal in singly linked list. Here elements are added in the singly linked list and the traversal is then done in the forward direction. Traversal is the very basic operation, which presents a huge part in almost every operation on a singly-linked list.

For instance, an algorithm may traverse a singly-linked list to find a value, find a position for insertion, or any kind of other operation.

For a singly-linked list, only forward direction traversal is possible. ByUsing InsertNext() , the program will then insert the elements into the list.

In  the traverse() function, "if condition " statement is used to check that the value of ‘node’ variable is equal to null. If the condition is true then execute the statement. While loop is used to check that the value of ‘node’ variable is not equal to null , but however, if the condition is true then execute the iteration of the loop.

The DeleteNext() function is used to check the condition that the value of ‘next’ variable is equal to null. If the condition is true then execute the statement. 

The next step of the process is to Check  that the list hasn’t reached the end of a list yet, does some actions with the current node, which is specific for a particular algorithm, and that the current node becomes previous and next node becomes current.
